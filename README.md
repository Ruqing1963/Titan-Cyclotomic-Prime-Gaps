# Titan-Cyclotomic-Prime-Gaps
Prime values of Q(n) = n⁴⁷ − (n−1)⁴⁷ as a cyclotomic norm form: complete local obstruction theorem, Bateman–Horn constant C_Q ≈ 8.64, Titan–BV decomposition (97.8% null moduli), exponential sum verification over 20 bad primes, and the Cyclotomic Bounded Gap Conjecture.
